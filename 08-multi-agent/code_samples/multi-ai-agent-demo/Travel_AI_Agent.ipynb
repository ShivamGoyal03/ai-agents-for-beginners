    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a multi-agent system for travel planning using Azure AI Agents. \n",
    "The system consists of specialized agents (flight, hotel, restaurant, excursion) that work together\n",
    "to help users plan their travel. The implementation uses two main architectural layers:\n",
    "1. **Service Layer**: Individual specialized AI agents that provide domain-specific assistance\n",
    "2. **Orchestration Layer**: The coordination mechanism that manages agent interactions and conversations"

    "# What I'm Trying to Achieve\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to create an orchestrated multi-agent system for comprehensive travel planning. The system uses specialized agents (flight, hotel, restaurant, and excursion) that work together seamlessly to provide a complete travel planning experience. Rather than forcing users to interact with multiple separate assistants, this approach creates a cohesive conversation flow where each agent handles its specialized domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges Faced\n",
    "\n",
    "While the system is functional, several challenges have emerged in the coordination and orchestration of the specialized agents. These include issues with agent selection logic, template rendering errors, and conversation flow management. Addressing these challenges is crucial to creating a seamless and efficient travel planning experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Blockers: Agent Coordination Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "Several challenges have emerged:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agent Selection Logic Issues**:\n",
    "   - The current selection strategy sometimes fails to properly parse agent names or select the correct next agent\n",
    "   - The orchestration prompts need fine-tuning to better understand conversation state\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Template Rendering Errors**:\n",
    "   - Experiencing `TemplateRenderException` errors when trying to pass conversation context between agents\n",
    "   - Variable handling in templates (using `{{$lastmessage}}`) is inconsistent\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Agent Response Processing**:\n",
    "   - Some agent responses are not being correctly formatted or displayed\n",
    "   - Need better parsing of response types and handling of multi-turn conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Conversation Flow Management**:\n",
    "   - Agents sometimes repeat information or fail to pick up where the previous agent left off\n",
    "   - Need better context preservation between agent transitions\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Known Issues**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   AgentChatException: Failed to select agent: Agent Failure - \n",
    "   Strategy unable to select next agent\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Currently addressing agent selection and mapping\n",
    "   - Improving task completion detection\n",
    "\n",
    "## Desired Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to create a seamless experience where these specialized agents work together coherently, in an non sequential order, handling complex travel planning tasks that span multiple domains while maintaining conversation context."
